            <h1>History Of Android Mascot</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But, you may not know that your friendly mascot has a very curious name and history! So follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>First Version</h2>

            <p>The first try to create a mascot surged in 2007 and came of a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="external">linkscape</a> (free software to image vetorizing) and created your own version of a robot. The objective was just personify the sistem to his team, there was no request from his business about the creation of a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre first version was called in pleasure to creator. Was the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
            
            <h2>A New Mascot Appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot was maturing and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://irinablok.com/android/" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok">
            </picture>
            
            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and more flat. The drawing should also generate quick identification with those who look at it. Then came <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot.</p>

            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="tiny" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> office and looked at the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>
